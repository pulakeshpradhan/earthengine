## USGS Landsat 8 Level 2, Collection 2, Tier 1

This is the title of the dataset. It tells us that we are dealing with data from the Landsat 8 satellite, which is at Level 2 (meaning it has undergone some processing like radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction), Collection 2 (the latest collection of Landsat data), and Tier 1 (the standard processing level).

## Dataset Availability

This section provides the time range for which the data is available: 2013-03-18T15:58:14Z to 2024-10-26T12:58:36Z. This means that the dataset contains images captured by Landsat 8 between these two dates.

## Dataset Provider

This section indicates that the United States Geological Survey (USGS) is the provider of this dataset. The USGS is responsible for collecting and processing the Landsat data.

## ID of the Dataset

This snippet provides the code to access this dataset within Google Earth Engine (GEE). The code is `ee.ImageCollection("LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2")`. This code allows you to load the Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level 2 Tier 1 image collection into GEE for further analysis and visualization.

## Tags

The tags section `lists keywords` associated with the dataset. Some of the relevant tags here are:

cfmask, cloud, fmask: These tags indicate that the dataset includes information about cloud cover and cloud masks.
global: This tag suggests that the dataset has global coverage.
18sr, landsat, lasrc, lc08, lst, reflectance, sr, usgs: These tags are related to the Landsat 8 satellite, its spectral bands, and the type of data (reflectance, surface temperature).

## Description

This section likely provides a brief overview of the dataset, such as its purpose, source, or any relevant background information.

## Bands

This section details the spectral bands that are included in the dataset. Each band captures information about a specific wavelength range of light. The table under "Bands" likely provides details about each band, including:

- Name: The name or identifier of the band.
- Units: The units of measurement for the data in that band (e.g., radiance, reflectance).
- Min/Max: The minimum and maximum possible values for the data in that band.
- `Scale: The scaling factor applied to the raw data values.`
- `Offset: The offset added to the scaled data values.`
- Wavelength: The central wavelength of the band in nanometers.
- Description: A description of the band and what it measures.

### Resolution

This section indicates the spatial resolution of the dataset, which is 30 meters in this case. This means that each pixel in the image represents a 30-meter by 30-meter area on the ground.


## Image Properties

This section likely provides information about the overall characteristics of the images in the dataset. This might include details like the image size, projection, coordinate system, or any other relevant image properties.

## Terms of Use

This section specifies the terms and conditions under which you can use the dataset. It might include information about licensing, attribution requirements, or any restrictions on how the data can be used.
Overall, this image appears to be a metadata summary for a remote sensing dataset, likely from a satellite or drone. It provides essential information about the dataset's content, characteristics, and how it can be used.
