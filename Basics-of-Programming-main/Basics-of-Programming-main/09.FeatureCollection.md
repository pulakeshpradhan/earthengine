# Understanding FeatureCollection in Google Earth Engine
=====================================================

This example demonstrates key operations on a `FeatureCollection`, including filtering, mapping, and aggregating.


## Loading a FeatureCollection
-----------------------------

```javascript
// Import the country feature collection
var countries = ee.FeatureCollection('USDOS/LSIB_SIMPLE/2017');
print(countries);
print(countries.first());
```
Here, we load a FeatureCollection containing country boundaries. The print statements show:
The entire FeatureCollection (metadata)
The first feature in the collection

## FeatureCollections Overview
-----------------------------
FeatureCollections are sets of features, where each feature has a geometry and properties.
Mapping over a FeatureCollection
---------------------------------
```JavaScript
// Map a function to get the country_na property of each feature 
var names = countries.map(function(x) {
  // Return a new feature with only the country_na property
  return ee.Feature(null, {'country_na': x.get('country_co')});
});
print(names);
```
This demonstrates the map function on a FeatureCollection:
Applies the given function to each feature in the collection.
Creates a new feature for each country, containing only the 'country_na' property.
Result is a new FeatureCollection with simplified features.

## Aggregating Data
------------------
```JavaScript
// Convert the result to a list
var list = names.aggregate_array('country_na');
// Print the list
print(list, 'country');
```
The aggregate_array function is used here to:
Extract a specific property ('country_na') from each feature.
Combine these values into a single list.

## Filtering FeatureCollections
------------------------------
```JavaScript
var india = countries.filter(ee.Filter.eq('country_na', 'Nepal'));
Map.addLayer(india);
```
This demonstrates filtering a FeatureCollection:
filter is used with an ee.Filter to select features meeting specific criteria.
Selects the feature where 'country_na' equals 'Nepal'.
Result is added to the map for visualization.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
---------------------------
1. Loading a FeatureCollection
Using ee.FeatureCollection() to load data.
2. Inspecting FeatureCollections
Using print() to examine the collection and its features.
3. Mapping over a FeatureCollection
Using map() to apply a function to each feature.
4. Creating new Features
Using ee.Feature() to create features with specific properties.
5. Aggregating data
Using aggregate_array() to collect values from all features.
6. Filtering FeatureCollections
Using filter() with ee.Filter to select specific features.
7. Visualization
Adding filtered features to the map.

## Conclusion
----------
FeatureCollections are versatile data structures in Earth Engine, useful for working with vector data like country boundaries, points of interest, or any data with geometric and non-geometric properties.
