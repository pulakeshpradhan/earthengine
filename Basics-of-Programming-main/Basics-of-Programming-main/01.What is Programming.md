# What is Programming?
====================================

**Programming** is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining the instructions that a computer follows to perform a specific task. These instructions, called **code**, are written in a programming language, which is a set of rules and syntax that a computer can understand.


### Key Components of Programming

#### 1. Analysis
 Identifying a problem or need and defining the requirements for a solution.


#### 2. Design
 Creating a detailed design or algorithm for the solution.


#### 3. Implementation
 Writing the code in a programming language.


#### 4. Testing
 Verifying that the code works correctly and fixing any errors.


#### 5. Maintenance
 Updating and modifying the code as needed.
