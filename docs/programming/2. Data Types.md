# Understanding Data Types (The Ingredients)

Just like a recipe has flour, sugar, and eggs, programming has strictly defined types of ingredients.
A computer cannot act on "flour" unless it knows it's a "Powder".

In Google Earth Engine, we use special types designed for maps.

## Basic Types (Standard Programming)

These are common to both JavaScript and Python.

1. **String**: Text (always in quotes).
   - `'Hello World'`
   - `'LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2'`

2. **Number**: Values for math.
   - `42` (Integer)
   - `3.14` (Decimal/Float)

3. **List**: A collection of items (in square brackets).
   - `['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Cherries']`
   - `[1, 2, 3]`

4. **Dictionary (Object in JS)**: Key-Value pairs (like an address book).
   - `{'name': 'Paris', 'population': 2161000}`
   - `{'color': 'red', 'size': 10}`

## Earth Engine Types (Geospatial)

These are the special containers Google created for satellite data.

1. **Image (`ee.Image`)**
   - A single picture (Raster).
   - Contains bands (Red, Green, Blue, NIR).

2. **ImageCollection (`ee.ImageCollection`)**
   - A folder of many images.
   - Example: All Landsat photos taken in 2023.

3. **Feature (`ee.Feature`)**
   - A single shape (Vector) with data attached.
   - Example: The border of France.

4. **FeatureCollection (`ee.FeatureCollection`)**
   - A group of features.
   - Example: All countries in the world.

## Why does this matter?

You can't mix them up!

- You can **Clip** an Image with a Feature.
- You can **Filter** an ImageCollection with a Geometry.
- But you cannot **Add** an Image to a Number directly (without using special functions).

Think of it like cooking: You can whisk eggs, but you can't whisk a rock!
