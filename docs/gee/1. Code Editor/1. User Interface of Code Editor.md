The Google Earth Engine (GEE) Code Editor at [code.earthengine.google.com](https://code.earthengine.google.com) is a powerful, web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the Earth Engine JavaScript API. It simplifies developing and managing complex geospatial workflows. Below is a detailed look at each component.

## Main Components of the Code Editor

### JavaScript Code Editor
- **Purpose**: The primary workspace for writing and editing code.
- **Features**:
  - Syntax highlighting and code formatting for easy readability.
  - Autocomplete suggestions for Earth Engine functions.
  - Syntax error checking with hints for common issues.
  - Buttons for running scripts, saving, resetting the map/console, and generating unique shareable links.
- **Note**: The editor supports `ECMAScript 5 (ES5)` but doesn’t support newer ES6+ features.

### Map Display
- **Purpose**: Interactive map for visualizing and exploring geospatial datasets.
- **Features**:
  - Allows zooming, panning, and multiple background styles.
  - Customize layer visibility and transparency using the Layer Manager.
  - Supports overlaying multiple layers and adjusting their individual visualization settings.

### API Reference (Docs Tab)
- **Location**: Left panel of the Code Editor.
- **Purpose**: Provides quick access to Earth Engine API documentation.
- **Features**:
  - Searchable library of Earth Engine functions, classes, and methods.
  - In-depth explanations and examples to support efficient coding.

### Script Manager (Scripts Tab)
- **Purpose**: Manages scripts and organizes them by access level.
- **Folders**:
  - **Owner**: Private scripts you own.
  - **Writer**: Scripts you have write access to.
  - **Reader**: Scripts you have read-only access to.
  - **Examples**: Example scripts provided by Google.
  - **Archive**: Contains older, legacy scripts.
- **Features**:
  - Organize scripts into folders, and rename, delete, or move scripts as needed.
  - Version history to revert or compare script changes.
  - Git integration, allowing scripts to be cloned, edited, or synchronized with external repositories like GitHub.

### Asset Manager (Assets Tab)
- **Purpose**: Manages user-uploaded assets for analysis, such as images or tables.
- **Features**:
  - Upload custom data and organize it for easy access.
  - Manage permissions for data sharing and usage in projects.

## Tabs and Panels for Output and Task Management

### Console Tab
- **Purpose**: Displays printed output, errors, and debugging information from scripts.
- **Features**:
  - Expand and inspect printed objects directly.
  - Interactive feedback when running complex code, allowing you to see results immediately.

### Tasks Tab
- **Purpose**: Manages long-running data processing tasks (e.g., large exports and imports).
- **Task Types**:
  - **Export**: For exporting data to Google Drive, Google Cloud Storage, etc.
  - **Import**: For uploading files into Earth Engine (e.g., .csv, .tif).
- **Features**:
  - Track progress of tasks, configure export options, and cancel tasks if necessary.
  - Full-page view for managing tasks in detail.

### Profiler
- **Purpose**: Measures resources (CPU and memory) consumed by specific parts of a script.
- **Features**:
  - Identifies areas where scripts may run slowly due to resource limitations.
  - Activate by clicking **Run with profiler** or pressing `Alt + Run` (Mac: `Option + Run`).

## Tools for Interactive Mapping and Data Exploration

### Inspector Tab
- **Purpose**: Allows interactive querying of the map to see values at specific points.
- **Features**:
  - Displays geographic coordinates and attribute values of clicked points.
  - Useful for verifying the values of data layers and geometries.

### Layer Manager
- **Purpose**: Adjusts the visibility and appearance of map layers.
- **Features**:
  - Set layer transparency, color stretch, and other visualization parameters.
  - Supports custom color palettes for specific layers.
  - *Note*: Accessed from the upper right of the map display.

### Search Tool
- **Purpose**: Quickly find datasets, locations, or saved scripts.
- **Features**:
  - Search for datasets by keywords (e.g., dataset name, sensor).
  - Click results to view dataset details and import options.

### Geometry Drawing Tools
- **Purpose**: Create custom geometries directly on the map for analysis or visualization.
- **Tools**:
  - **Point**: Place a single point.
  - **Line**: Draw lines.
  - **Polygon**: Create polygon shapes.
  - **Rectangle**: Draw rectangular, planar shapes.
- **Features**:
  - New geometries are imported as layers that can be locked to prevent further editing.
  - Configure geometries as **Features** or **FeatureCollections** for flexible use.

---

## Imports Section
- **Purpose**: Displays and manages datasets and geometries imported into the script.
- **Features**:
  - Auto-generates JavaScript code for dataset imports.
  - Organize and convert imports for reusability across scripts.

---

## Script Sharing and Link Generation

### Script Links and “Get Link” Feature
- **Purpose**: Allows sharing of scripts via URL links.
- **Link Types**:
  - **Snapshot Link**: Encodes the exact state of the script, including code, layers, and map position.
  - **Saved Script Link**: Always loads the most recent saved version of the script.
- **Features**:
  - Manage links with options to prevent auto-execution, hide the code pane, and set parameters via URL fragments.

### Script Link Management
- **Purpose**: Access previously generated links.
- **Features**:
  - Recall, remove, and download links.
  - Enables sharing scripts in a controlled and documented way.

## Additional Help and Support

### Help Button
- **Location**: Top right of the Code Editor.
- **Purpose**: Accesses help resources, including:
  - Documentation and Developer’s Guide.
  - Guided Code Editor tour and a list of keyboard shortcuts.
  - Feedback submission for bug reports or feature requests.
