// Export.table.toAsset(GAULLevel2, 'GAULAdminLayersLevel2'); 
//Last task will take more time to run as the feature collection has many features covering entire world 

// Import your newly created asset into the script and check it by printing or adding as Map Layer

// print(MaharashtraDistAssetGAUL);
// Map.addLayer(MaharashtraDistAssetGAUL);
// Map.addLayer(AdminLayersL2AssetGAUL);

//Now you can filter for any Administrative Layer from your newly created asset

/*You may not be able to export maharashtraAdm2Map as Shapefile to Drive even though you can 
export it to your assets. That's because coastal districts of Maharashtra have more than one
geometry type - not just polygon but even points and linear rings for representing small 
islands whereas shapefile cannot contain multiple geometry types. It has to be single geometry 
type such as a polygon eg. Pune District which has only geometry type.You can check that by 
printing isolated features onto the console and check the metadata*/

Export.table.toDrive({
  collection : puneDistrictFromGAUL, 
  description : 'Pune_GAUL',
  folder : 'GEEExports',

/*After submitting the task in the task tab and its completion, check your Google Drive 
for the folder, download the zip file of shapefile, extract file and open 
the shapefile in any GIS software */
