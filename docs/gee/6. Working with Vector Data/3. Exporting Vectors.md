# Exporting Vectors (Boundaries & Shapes)

Once you have filtered or processed your features, you can download them.

## 1. Export as Shapefile (SHP)

To save your vector data for use in ArcGIS or QGIS, export as a **Shapefile**.

=== "JavaScript"
    ```javascript
    // Define the collection to export
    var myCollection = france; // From previous example

    // Export it
    Export.table.toDrive({
      collection: myCollection,
      description: 'France_Boundary',
      fileFormat: 'SHP'
    });
    ```
    *If exporting a large collection, it will be split into part files.*

=== "Python"
    ```python
    import geemap

    # Export as Shapefile
    geemap.ee_export_vector_to_drive(
        france, 
        description='France_Boundary', 
        fileFormat='SHP'
    )
    ```

## 2. Export as CSV (Table)

If your features are points or just data (like a list of cities), you can export as a spreadsheet.

=== "JavaScript"
    ```javascript
    Export.table.toDrive({
      collection: myCollection,
      description: 'City_List',
      fileFormat: 'CSV'
    });
    ```

=== "Python"
    ```python
    geemap.ee_export_vector_to_drive(
        myCollection,
        description='City_List',
        fileFormat='CSV'
    )
    ```
