# Google Earth Engine Exercises

---

## Module 1: Earth Engine Basics

### 01. Hello World
- List the five largest cities in the world: Tokyo, Delhi, Shanghai, Mexico City, Sao Paulo.
- Create a list called `largeCities` with these city names.
- Print the list to the console.

### 02. Working with Image Collections
- Locate the *Sentinel-2 Level-1C* dataset in the [Earth Engine catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets).
- Copy and paste the code snippet to load this dataset.
- Modify the code to display images for your home city.

### 03. Filtering Image Collections
- Apply filters to an image collection to select images by:
  - Specific criteria using `ee.Filter.eq()`, `ee.Filter.lt()`, etc.
  - Date range using `ee.Filter.date()`.
  - Location using `ee.Filter.bounds()`.

### 04. Creating Mosaics and Composites from Image Collections
- Create a median composite image for a specific time period.
- Load an image collection and apply the median reducer.

### 05. Working with Feature Collections
- Filter a feature collection to select specific regions.
- Display the filtered regions on the map.

### 06. Importing Data
- Import a dataset and apply filters to select specific features.
- Display the filtered results on the map.

### 07. Clipping Images
- Clip an image to the geometry of a specified feature.
- Display the clipped image on the map.

### 08. Exporting Data
- Export the processed image or feature collection as an asset.
- Use `Export.image.toDrive()` or `Export.table.toDrive()` as needed.

- Aggregate data over a specific time period or spatial extent.

### 04. Cloud Masking
- Implement cloud masking techniques to improve image quality.
- Use cloud probability bands to mask clouds.

### 05. Reducers
- Use reducers to summarize data from image collections.
- Apply functions like mean, median, or mode.

### 06. Time-Series Charts
- Create time-series charts to visualize changes over time.
- Use `ui.Chart.image.series()` to generate the charts.

## Module 3: Supervised Classification

### 01. Basic Supervised Classification
- Perform supervised classification with training data.
- Train a classifier and apply it to an image collection.

### 02. Accuracy Assessment
- Calculate accuracy metrics for a classified image.
- Use a confusion matrix and overall accuracy metrics.

### 03. Improving the Classification
- Enhance classification results by adding spectral indices.
- Retrain the classifier using these new features.

### 04. Exporting Classification Results
- Export the classified image as an asset.
- Use `Export.image.toDrive()` with suitable parameters.

### 05. Calculating Area
- Compute the area of different land cover classes.
- Print area statistics to the console.

### 03. Direct Classification of Change
- Classify change directly using machine learning techniques.
- Assess land cover changes over time.

### 04. Post-Classification Comparison
- Compare pre- and post-classification results.
- Visualize areas of change on the map.
