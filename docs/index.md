## What is This?

**Google Earth Engine** is a free tool that lets you analyze satellite images of our planet. Think of it as having access to thousands of satellite photos taken over the past 40+ years, all in one place.

You don't need to be a programmer or scientist to get started. This guide will teach you everything step by step.

## What Can You Do With It?

With Google Earth Engine, you can:

- **Track changes over time** - See how forests, cities, or rivers have changed over decades
- **Monitor water bodies** - Find lakes, rivers, and track floods
- **Study land use** - Identify farmland, forests, urban areas, and more
- **Analyze climate patterns** - Look at rainfall, temperature, and vegetation health
- **Create maps** - Make professional maps for research or presentations

All of this runs in your web browser - no special software needed!
